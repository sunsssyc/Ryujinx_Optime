# Metal backend — picture and stability bug ledger (TOTK), as of 2026-09-05

One line per bug: what the user saw, what it really was, the commit that fixed it, how it
was verified, and the switch if one exists. The long-form investigations live in the
hand-off documents (`METAL_HANDOFF_2026-07-18.md`, `METAL_CURRENT_HANDOFF_2026-08-02.md`,
`METAL_WHITE_FLASH_HANDOFF_2026-08-08.md`, `METAL_PERF_HANDOFF_2026-09-05.md`) and in the
commit messages; this file is the index. Dates are the fix dates.

## Fixed

| Symptom (as reported) | Root cause | Fix | Verified by | Switch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Whole picture cyan-tinted and crushed blacks | `CAMetalLayer` had no colour space, so an sRGB image was shown raw on a P3 display | bd4827f1 (2026-07-18) | screenshots against Vulkan | - |
| Vegetation billboards vanish or flicker up close | non-indexed draws through the topology-conversion path dropped `instanceCount` / `firstVertex` / `firstInstance` | b2f08b2e (2026-07-19) | draw trace: the missing plants were the lost instances | - |
| Gloom (miasma) renders as sparse red streaks instead of a full field | Metal cannot use block-compressed formats on 3D textures; the backend advertised support, so 4 BC4 volume-noise textures decoded to garbage and the material discarded almost every fragment | 14c8533e (2026-07-24) | Metal vs Vulkan screenshots at the same save | - |
| Same, plus five validation-layer classes: texture usage `Unknown`, false SIMD-width promise on compute pipelines, illegal compute barrier scope, mip copies out of range, 65535 scissor sentinel | each an undefined-behaviour path the validation layer named | 161aa69c, 9ddf5f2f, 93c44024 (2026-07-19) | `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 ... _MODE=nslog` count went to zero | - |
| Gloom deals damage in places that are safe on Vulkan (Depths edge) | the backend reported `supportsVertexStoreAndAtomics: false`, so vertex shaders with storage writes went through the vertex-as-compute emulation and their writes never reached the buffer; the game's damage check read back zeros | 45cc9d87 (2026-07-25) | user's play at the Depths edge; not seen since | - |
| Bushes and grass missing in the Depths (a whole clump gone) | `UpdateCullMode` set "cull both faces" from the stale face register even with culling disabled; the backend emulates cull-both with a 0x0 scissor, so double-sided vegetation cards produced no fragments at all | ab451955 (2026-07-25) | three in-game A/Bs (discard, depth compare, Xcode post-transform) left only rasterisation; scissor fixed it | - |
| Single-frame white (sometimes red) full-screen flash by day | translator dead-code elimination (`Optimizer.RemoveNode`) cascaded and cleared the source list of a still-live call; the sun-visibility kernel's atomic argument was left uninitialised and the 1x1 auto-exposure texture saturated to 1.0 for that frame | 01a1e37f (2026-08-26); mechanism e63dc628 (2026-08-22) | offline re-translation of the guest shader; per-frame exposure probe | `RYUJINX_METAL_FLASHGUARD` (the earlier present-side mitigation) is withdrawn |
| Hard-edged teal sheets over Depths terrain (fog looks like stone slabs) | the MSL emitter dropped the constant offset of `texelFetch`, so the 12-tap depth-fade neighbourhood collapsed onto one texel | fix in the good-display merge, CodeGenVersion 7378; A/B toggles b1a39608 (2026-08-26) | same-build A/B with `MSL_FETCH_OFFSET=0` reproducing it | `RYUJINX_MSL_FETCH_OFFSET=0` reproduces |
| Everything too dark on the main branch (6.5x in the Depths) | `Window.Present` swapped the Unorm shadow texture for its sRGB sibling (a leftover flash mitigation); presenting through an sRGB view decodes once more and the whole transfer function is lost | 3d33ab70 (2026-08-26, v349) | luminance percentiles matched stock Ryujinx 1.2 to the decimal; the gamma-curve shape of the error was the tell | `RYUJINX_GPU_PRESENT_SIBLING=1` restores the old behaviour |
| Depths map layer vanishes for one frame (terrain, grid, frame; UI intact) | `TexturePool.GetInternal` returned the cached `Items[id]` without comparing the descriptor, so a slot rewritten after the per-frame sync handed out the previous occupant | 7c1d8ef4 (2026-08-29) | 10 events per 10 minutes -> 0, same build, hot-switched; stock Ryujinx had it too | `RYUJINX_POOL_DESC_CHECK=0` |
| Five crash shapes in the encoder/command-buffer lifecycle (double commit, double endEncoding, live encoder at commit, ...) | non-backend threads called `FlushCommandsImpl` directly (sync creation, counters, staging, texture read-back) | 46b58c0c (2026-08-30) | thread census; crashes stopped | - |
| Guest null dereferences on respawn after a fall (three different PCs) | the mod's frame cap at 60 breaks the game's own timing; not an emulator bug | config: `MaxFPS` 45 (now 50, verified crash-free on 2026-09-04) | 3/3 reproduction at 60, none at 45 | `sdcard/UltraCam/TOTK/Config/maxlastbreath.ini` |
| Water surface collapses into a tiled sand texture | RG11B10 self-reads were being served by framebuffer fetch, but refraction samples the HDR target at a displaced coordinate, which fetch cannot express | 02f6962c (2026-09-03, v408) | user's play; hazard+fetch reproduces, R32F-only does not | fetch formats are R32F only |
| Black decal blocks flickering with primitive order (hill save) | a draw that writes the slot it reads was fetched; the back face read the front face's fresh write instead of the pre-draw value | e186fff2 (2026-09-03, v409) | burst diff 301 cells -> 0 | - |
| Black wedges at the hill save with `barrier=hazard` | hazard mode skipped guest barriers that guard stale-policy self-reads and fragment storage stores (visibility feedback flags) | c0f67455 (2026-09-04, v410/v411) | burst diff 241/291 -> 108/23 (baseline noise) | `RYUJINX_METAL_BARRIER_SCOPE=all` |
| Camera-turn hitches, occasional freezes up to 1.7 s when turning into new materials | render pipeline states were built synchronously on the render thread: ~1000 builds per 22 s turn, 0.3 ms each with a warm OS shader cache but 170-200 stacked into one frame, and the rare cold build at 80 ms to 1.6 s | 02376448 (2026-09-12, v491): builds on the thread pool, a per-frame 4 ms wait budget, the draw skipped past it as with a still-compiling shader | same save, same turns, two launches at 2K: frames >40 ms 129 -> 38, >60 ms 54 -> 6, longest 1751 -> 197 ms, median unchanged | `RYUJINX_METAL_ASYNC_PSO=0`, `RYUJINX_METAL_ASYNC_PSO_WAIT_MS`, hot file `/tmp/ryujinx-metal-async-pso` |
| Stopping emulation never returns to the game list; shutdown logs off-thread dispose and cross-thread flush warnings | ThreadedRenderer disposes the base renderer on the caller thread after stopping its loop, while the loop's thread stays alive; the final flush was marshalled onto the stopped loop and waited forever | 2f8399d6 + 502793e6 (2026-09-11, v488): the disposing thread adopts the command buffer pool, interrupts run inline once the loop stopped | stop emulation: 0 warnings, window returns | - |
| Guest abort inside nn::os::WaitConditionVariable with no cause in the log | the kernel discarded svcBreak's info word (the failing Result) and filed the "expected" svc results (InvalidState, TimedOut, Cancelled) at trace level | 0bd64783 + 58075cb9 (2026-09-06/12): the Break info word, failed condvar waits and mutex waiters released by a thread exit are logged | one occurrence on 2026-09-06, cause still open; diagnostics only | - |
| Wall/ground sunlight changes for one frame at the Nachoyah Shrine manual save | Resource preparation can retire the render encoder after the dirty-state check, leaving clean binding sets unprepared for the new encoder | v445 (source committed with this ledger): reprepare all render bindings after encoder/command-buffer transitions during prepass; cached output-map correction also retained | v444 on/control: 0/16 PRESENT jump edges per 6000 frames; clean v445 600s + user-reload 180s video: 0 patch excursions, ~49.6 FPS, no sustained RSS growth | `RYUJINX_METAL_PREPASS_REBIND=2` records without repairing; default 1 |

## Open

| Symptom | State | Where the trail is |
|---|---|---|
| Distant clouds show through mountains, flipping between states | reproduces with every optimisation off; likely the game's cloud impostor reading a periodically refreshed depth; upstream-class | memory note `metal-nvn-self-skip` |
| Fog sheet / sky-island cloud band missing or popping for 1-3 frames every 1-2 s | unresolved; the old binding-136 evidence was invalidated by the 2026-09-05 declaration audit: the watched program only uses 128/129, and the probe included stale slots from previous draws | `METAL_PERF_HANDOFF_2026-09-05.md`, open issue 1 and its correction |
| Occasional one-frame flashes while roaming on v445, resembling content from another location | user-reported after the static-save fix; v445/mode 1 verified active; mechanism and relationship to the fog issue unconfirmed, pending event location/time and bad-frame capture | local investigation entry `roaming-report-20260905-222443`; static-save validation does not establish roaming coverage |
| Segfault in the driver's `drawIndexedPrimitives` (nil object at +0x8a0), four times on 2026-09-04 including a clean build, once more on 2026-09-05 | not seen since 2026-09-05; crash ring (v425/v426) armed to catch the next one | `METAL_PERF_HANDOFF_2026-09-05.md`, open issue 2 |

## Snow-platform fix: v483 (2026-09-06)

The high-frequency campfire platform corruption responds reversibly to Metal's guest
texture-barrier policy. Same-process 30-second controls: hazard 271/1349 candidate
returns, all 0/1364, hazard 280/1381, all 0/1373 (game frames, around49FPS). Video confirms
one-frame platform loss in hazard mode; repeat all-mode video's maximum ROI return
score is0.54 versus8.79 in hazard mode. These are scene-scoped measurements, not a count
of all bugs. An independent white flash was captured on Vulkan too and remains open.

The barrier-time check uses current bindings, which need not describe later consumers;
the draw-time self-read policy cannot replace every skipped guest barrier. v483 restores
honoring guest texture barriers by default; hazard skipping requires explicit opt-in.
Its clean candidate is HEAD2fe2cec8 plus only this Pipeline.cs change. Build/signature passed, followed by 600 seconds of default-setting mixed gameplay.
User confirmed platform no longer flickers; independent white flashes remain. RSS fell
12.24→9.80 GiB; mixed-scene weighted FPS46.36, no skipped draws. Reviewed video peaks
showed white flash, wind, or movement, not the old platform disappearance. This closes
this tested platform issue, not all older roaming reports. Committed as 5b5e7519 (Pipeline.cs only; probes stay uncommitted). Evidence and patch: local `artifacts/diagnostics/fog-2026-09-05/v483-*`
and `v482-pass-arms.jsonl`. See START_HERE for current PID and validation status.

## Candidate correction, not a resolved picture bug

`MetalRenderer.LoadProgramBinary` omitted `ShaderInfo.FragmentOutputMap` when creating
the Metal program. Newly translated programs passed it correctly. The omission disabled
the write-mask protection for channels absent from a cached fragment shader. The v429
candidate passes the saved map; cache loading and the masked-pipeline counter confirm
that it runs. Sunlight still flickers in v429, so this correction does **not** close the
sunlight issue by itself. v445 retains it alongside the validated prepass rebind fix. Both source changes are committed with this ledger; the v445 binary remains a local artifact.
