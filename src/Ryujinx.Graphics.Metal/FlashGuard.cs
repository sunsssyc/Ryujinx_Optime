    /// On this backend a fraction of frames reach Present with the source image a flat
    /// near-white - the scene is gone while the HUD still composites over it. The cause
    /// is unresolved (see docs/METAL_WHITE_FLASH_HANDOFF_2026-08-08.md); what is well
    /// established is that such a frame is uniform, which is something a rendered scene
    /// never is. This samples the source just before the present blit and, when enough of
    /// those samples are saturated, presents the last frame that was not flat instead.
    ///
    /// The test counts saturated samples rather than asking them to be equal. A flat frame
    /// keeps its HUD, so a uniformity test is decided by whether a sample lands on the
    /// minimap - which is why an earlier version of this fired on some camera angles and
    /// not others, and reported success it had not achieved.
    ///
    /// Two costs, both real:
    /// - one GPU sync per frame, to have the samples on the CPU before deciding
    /// - a repeated frame whenever it fires, so motion stutters instead of flashing
    ///
    /// Off unless RYUJINX_METAL_FLASHGUARD=1. /tmp/ryujinx-metal-flashguard overrides it
    /// with 0 or 1, re-read once a frame, so both arms can be measured in one session.
    ///
    /// Measured with the corrected criterion, alternating both arms twice inside one
    /// session and judging from compositor screenshots: 35.0% of frames flat with it off,
    /// 0.0% with it on, and the luma still varying (151..162) rather than frozen on a
    /// repeated frame. It does suppress the artefact.
    ///
    /// Still off by default, because it destabilises the emulator: with it on, the
    /// process exits during ordinary play, silently, within a minute or two of camera
    /// movement. The signature seen when a report was produced is EXC_BAD_ACCESS inside
    /// AGX FramebufferGen3, reached from renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor - the driver
    /// faulting while it builds this pass's descriptor. Rebuilding the keep texture on
    /// resize was one cause and is fixed (this game has dynamic resolution, so the old
    /// code released a texture an in-flight command buffer was about to attach); the
